**Terms of Use**

When downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you - so you should make sure to read them carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to copy or modify the application, any part of it, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the application, nor should you attempt to translate the application into other languages or create derivative Versions. The application itself and all associated trademarks, copyrights, database rights and other intellectual property rights still belong to Alexander Gusev.
 Alexander Gusev strives to ensure that the application is as useful and effective as possible. For this reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the application or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for an app or its services without explaining to you exactly what you are paying for.

The application stores and processes the personal data that you have provided to us in order to provide my service. You are responsible for the security of your phone and access to the application. Therefore, we recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and restrictions imposed by the official operating system of your device. This can make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malware, compromise the security features of your phone, and it may mean that the application will not work properly or at all.

The application does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

You should know that there are certain things for which [The Developer/Company name] will not be responsible. Some features of the app will require an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile operator, but Alexander Gusev cannot be held responsible for the fact that the application does not work in full if you do not have access to Wi-Fi and you do not have any of your data left.

If you use the app outside of the Wi-Fi zone, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile operator will still apply. As a result, your mobile operator may charge you for data transmission during the entire connection time while accessing the application or other third-party fees. When using the app, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including data roaming charges, if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not a bill payer for the device on which you use the app, please keep in mind that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer to use the app.

Similarly, Alexander Gusev may not always be responsible for how you use the app, i.e. you need to make sure that your device remains charged – if its battery runs out and you cannot turn it on to use the Service, Alexander Gusev cannot take responsibility.

Regarding Alexander Gusev's responsibility for your use of the application, when you use the application, it is important to keep in mind that, although we strive to ensure that it is constantly updated and corrected, we rely on third parties who provide us with information so that we can make it available to you. Alexander Gusev is not responsible for any losses, direct or indirect, that you will incur as a result of fully relying on this functionality of the application.

At some point we may want to update the app. The app is currently available – the system requirements (and any additional systems we decide to extend the app's availability to) may change and you will need to download updates if you want to continue using the app. Alexander Gusev does not promise that it will always update the application so that it matches you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept app updates when they are offered to you, we may also wish to stop providing the app and stop using it at any time without notifying you. Unless we inform you otherwise, upon any termination (a), the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will cease; (b) you must stop using the application and (if necessary) delete it from your device.

**Changes to these Terms and Conditions**

We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Therefore, it is recommended that you periodically review this page for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These Terms and conditions come into force from 2022-01-21
